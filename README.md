# nodeJS-Robot
This is my first try in node js.
As a Front End developer, I want to expand my knowledge in backend part. So I tried to learn NodeJs. This project is my first try to work with node.js.
It is fun to learn new skills, and I try to enjoy the path.
This Repo is going to have 3 projects in Node js. I am persuing a course in MaktabKhune. I started my journey in react, 3 years ago in that website too.

## First project
The first project is about learning how to read from files in node js. It is about a robot which obey the commands in text file. 
I implemented using class in javaScript and node Js API s for reading the file.
